                    AI Superstore is a platform that provides access to premium AI tools without requiring expensive
                    monthly subscriptions. We offer a pay-as-you-go model with day passes and credit packs, allowing you
                    to use powerful AI tools only when you need them.

                  <AccordionContent>
                    Unlike most AI platforms that require monthly subscriptions, AI Superstore offers a pay-as-you-go
                    model. You can purchase day passes for short-term access or credit packs that never expire. This
                    makes it perfect for occasional users, students, and professionals who don't need constant access to
                    AI tools.

                  <AccordionContent>
                    We offer a wide range of AI tools across categories including image generation (DALLÂ·E 3, Leonardo
                    AI), voice synthesis (ElevenLabs, Whisper), code assistance (GitHub Copilot, Replit), and data
                    analysis (Tableau, ChatGPT with ADA). Our catalog is constantly expanding with new tools.

                  <AccordionContent>
                    Day passes give you access to AI tools for a fixed period (1 or 3 days). Once activated, you can use
                    the tools until the pass expires, with the specified usage limits. The 1-Day Pass costs $1.99 and
                    includes selected tools, while the 3-Day Pass costs $4.99 and gives you access to our entire
                    catalog.

                    No, credits never expire. You can use them whenever you need, making them perfect for occasional
                    users or those with varying usage patterns. This ensures you only pay for what you use, with no
                    pressure to consume credits within a specific timeframe.
